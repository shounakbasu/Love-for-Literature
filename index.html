    In this webpage I tried to give tribute to authors who have had an influence on me and have provoked my thought. I may for get to name many of them because there are so many of them.
    Each Author, Poet, Novelist have their own unique outlook towards life, they have their own way of perception. A flame burns in all of them irrespective of the 
    language or format they use. Some of these authors have had a life long influence on me. Some have made me weep. some have made me laugh, some have been able to hold in front of me 
    pictures and scenes as if I was there in that scene or moment, they made me feel the complete experience.

    <h2>Love for different literary works</h2>
  <p>	
    Literature broadly is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings
    specifically considered to be an art form, especially prose fiction, drama, and poetry. In recent
    centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature, much of which has been transcribed.

    <h2>Something About Rabindranath Tagore</h2>
    <details>
    <summary>His Childhood</summary>
    <p>
        Tagore was born at No. 7 Dwarkanath Tagore Lane, Jorasanko the address of his family mansion. In turn, 
        Jorasanko was located in the Bengali section of north Calcutta (now Kolkata), located near Chitpur Road. 
        He was the son of Debendranath Tagore (1817–1905) and Sarada Devi (1830–1875). Debendranath Tagore had 
        formulated the Brahmo faith propagated by his friend, the reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy. Debendranath became 
        the central figure in Brahmo society after Roy's death, who was addressed out of respect by followers as 
        Maharishi.[4] He continued to lead the Adi Brahmo Samaj until he died.

    <summary>His Works</summary>
    <p>
        Known mostly for his poetry, Tagore wrote novels, essays, short stories, travelogues, dramas, 
        and thousands of songs. Of Tagore's prose, his short stories are perhaps most highly regarded; 
        he is indeed credited with originating the Bengali-language version of the genre. His works are
        frequently noted for their rhythmic, optimistic, and lyrical nature. Such stories mostly borrow
        from the lives of common people. Tagore's non-fiction grappled with history, linguistics, and
        spirituality. He wrote autobiographies. His travelogues, essays, and lectures were compiled 
        into several volumes, including Europe Jatrir Patro (Letters from Europe) and Manusher Dhormo 
         (The Religion of Man). His brief chat with Einstein, "Note on the Nature of Reality", is included 
        as an appendix to the latter. On the occasion of Tagore's 150th birthday, an anthology (titled 
        Kalanukromik Rabindra Rachanabali) of the total body of his works is currently being published 
        in Bengali in chronological order. This includes all versions of each work and fills about 
        eighty volumes.[96] In 2011, Harvard University Press collaborated with Visva-Bharati University 
        to publish The Essential Tagore, the largest anthology of Tagore's works available in English; 
        it was edited by Fakrul Alam and Radha Chakravarthy and marks the 150th anniversary of Tagore's
        birth.[97]

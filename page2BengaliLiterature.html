        <h3>Jibananda Das</h3>
        <p>
            Jībanānanda Dāś was an Indian poet, writer, novelist and essayist in the Bengali language. Popularly 
            called "Rupashi Banglar Kabi'', Das is the most read poet after Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul 
            Islam in Bangladesh and West Bengal. Born in Barishal to a Vaidya-Brahmo family, Das studied English 
            literature at Presidency College, Kolkata and earned his MA from Calcutta University.[3] He had a 
            troubling career and suffered financial hardship throughout his life. He taught at many colleges but 
            was never granted tenure. He settled in Kolkata after the partition of India. Das died on 22 October 
            1954, eight days after being hit by a tramcar
        </br>
            Jibanananda Das was very underrated poet in his time; he wrote profusely, but as he was a recluse and 
            introvert, he did not publish most of his writings during his lifetime. Most of his work were hidden, a
            nd only seven volumes of his poems were published.[9] After his death, it was discovered that apart from 
            poems, Das wrote 21 novels and 108 short stories. His notable works include Ruposhi Bangla, Banalata Sen, 
            Mahaprithibi, Shreshtha Kavita.[3] Das's early poems exhibit the influence of Kazi Nazrul Islam,[3] but 
            in the latter half of the 20th century, Das's influence became one of the major catalysts in the making 
            of Bengali poetry.

        Das received Rabindra-Memorial Award for Banalata Sen in 1953 at All Bengal Rabindra Literature Convention.[3] Das's Shrestha Kavita won the Sahitya Academy Award in 1955

        <summary>The Greatness of his works</summary>
        <p>
            Jibanananda successfully integrated Bengali poetry with the slightly older Eurocentric international modernist 
            movement of the early 20th century. In this regard he possibly owes as much to his exotic exposure as to his 
            innate poetic talent. Although hardly appreciated during his lifetime, many critics believe that his modernism, 
            evoking almost all the suggested elements of the phenomenon, remains untranscended to date, despite the emergence 
            of many notable poets during the last 50 years. His success as a modern Bengali poet may be attributed to the facts 
            that Jibanananda Das in his poetry not only discovered the tract of the slowly evolving 20th-century modern mind, 
            sensitive and reactive, full of anxiety and tension, bu that he invented his own diction, rhythm and vocabulary, 
            with an unmistakably indigenous rooting, and that he maintained a self-styled lyricism and imagism mixed with an 
            extraordinary existentialist sensuousness, perfectly suited to the modern temperament in the Indian context, 
            whereby he also averted fatal dehumanisation that could have alienated him from the people.
        </br></br>
            Also noteworthy are his sonnets, the most famous being seven untitled pieces collected in the publication 
            Shaat-ti Tarar Timir ("The Blackness of Seven Stars), where he describes, on one hand, his attachment to 
            his motherland, and on the other, his views about life and death in general. They are noteworthy not only 
            because of the picturesque description of nature that was a regular feature of most of his work but also 
            for the use of metaphors and allegories. For example, a lone owl flying about in the night sky is taken 
            as an omen of death, while the anklets on the feet of a swan symbolises the vivacity of life. The following 
            are undoubtedly the most oft-quoted line from this collection:

            বাংলার মুখ আমি দেখিয়াছি, তাই আমি পৃথিবীর রূপ খুঁজিতে যাই না আর...

        <summary>His Works</summary>
        <p>
            Jibanananda scholar Clinton B. Seely has termed Jibanananda Das as "Bengal's most cherished poet since 
            Rabindranath Tagore". On the other hand, to many, reading the poetry of Jibanananda Das is like 
            stumbling upon a labyrinth of the mind similar to what one imagines Camus's 'absurd' man toiling through. 
            Indeed, Jibanananda Das's poetry is sometimes an outcome of profound feeling painted in imagery of a type 
            not readily understandable. Sometimes the connection between the sequential lines is not obvious. In fact, 
            Jibanananda Das broke the traditional circular structure of poetry (introduction-middle-end) and the pattern 
            of logical sequence of words, lines and stanzas. Consequently, the thematic connotation is often hidden under 
            a rhythmic narrative that requires careful reading between the lines.
        </br></br>
            Annadashankar Roy called him the truest poet. Jibanananda Das conceived a poem and moulded it up in the way most 
            natural for him. When a theme occurred to him, he shaped it with words, metaphors and imagery that distinguished 
            him from all others. Jibanananda Das's poetry is to be felt, rather than merely read or heard.
        </br></br>
            While reading Jibanananda Das, one often encounters references to olden times and places, events and personalities. 
            A sense of time and history is an unmistakable element that has shaped Jibanananda Das's poetic world to a great 
            extent. However, he lost sight of nothing surrounding him. Unlike many of his peers who blindly imitated the renowned 
            western poets in a bid to create a new poetic domain and generated spurious poetry, Jibanananda Das remained anchored 
            in his own soil and time, successfully assimilating experiences real and virtual and producing hundreds of unforgettable 
            lines. His intellectual vision was thoroughly embedded in Bengal's nature and beauty

            <p>
                Manik Bandopadhyay was an Indian writer and novelist, regarded as one of the major figures of 20th century Bengali literature.
                 During a lifespan of 48 years, plagued simultaneously by illness and financial crisis, he produced 36 novels and nearly 250 
                 short stories. His notable works include Padma Nadir Majhi[3] (The Boatman on The River Padma, 1936) and Putul Nacher Itikatha 
                 (The Puppet's Tale, 1936), Shahartali (Suburbia, 1941) and Chatushkone (The Quadrilateral, 1948).

            <summary>Early life</summary>
            <p>
                Bandopadhyay was born on 19 May 1908 in Dumka, a small town in Santal Parganas district in the state of Bihar in British India. 
                His real name was Prabodh Kumar Bandhopaddhay. His nick name was Manik. His ancestral home was Bikrampur, in Dhaka district (present-day Bangladesh).[6] He was 
                the fifth of the fourteen children of his parents, Harihar Bandopadhyay and Niroda Devi. Harihar was a sub-registrar who was 
                posted in different parts of Bengal. This gave Manik to experience life and living of people in different parts of Bengal in 
                his early life.
